/*  --- Borrowing & References

    🔑 Key Points:
    1. "Borrowing" = creating a *reference* (`&`) to a value, not taking ownership.
    2. Immutable references (`&T`) let you read data. You can have *many*.
    3. Mutable references (`&mut T`) let you change data. You can only have *one*.
    4. You *cannot* have mutable and immutable references at the same time.
    5. The compiler guarantees references are always valid (no dangling).
