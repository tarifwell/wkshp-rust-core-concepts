/* Hello World & Cargo

🔑 Key Concepts : 
    - cargo is Rust's package manager and build system.
    - `cargo new <name>` creates a new Rust project (like this one).
    - `cargo run` to run the project.
    - `fn main()` is the main function, the entry point for every Rust program.
    - `println!` is a "macro" that prints text to the console.

fn main() {
    //this is a one line comment
    println!("Hello, world from Example 1!");

    /* This is a 
       multi-line comment */
    /// This is a documentation comment
    println!("Hello, world from Example 1 again!");
