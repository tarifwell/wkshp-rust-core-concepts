/* Constants 

🔑 Key Concepts:
- Declared using `const`.
- Always immutable (can't use `mut`).
- Type annotation is required.
- Value must be known at compile time.
- Naming convention: UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.
- Live for the entire program duration.
- Inlined where used (replaced with the value at compile time).
